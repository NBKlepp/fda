<p>
<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics. </b>

<p>
This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'dynamics', 'activity', 'event', 'process' and 'state' oriented models.
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
<!-- (see <a href = "feature_matrix.html"> feature matrix </a>) -->
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.

<p>
The <b>ScalaTion 1.1</b> version is a migration from version 1.0 (which works with Scala 2.9.x) to Scala 2.10.x.
The code currently contains deprecated features.
Future directions include adding 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<p>
Please read the <a href = LICENSE.html> LICENSE </a> file (an MIT style license).

<h3> Installation Instructions </h3>

Requires:
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Scala 2.10.x</a> and
<a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads">Java 7</a>

<h4>1. Download one of the following two files:</h4>

<a href = "../scalation.tar.gz"> scalation.tar.gz </a> <br>
<a href = "../scalation.zip"> scalation.zip </a>

<p>
<h4>2. Untar or unzip the file:</h4>

$ tar xvfz scalation.tar.gz <br>
$ unzip scalation.zip

<p>
<h4>3. Export the SCALATION_CLASSES environment variable to point at class files: (use the second version for sbt)</h4>

export SCALATION_CLASSES=$HOME/scalation_1.1/classes
#export SCALATION_CLASSES=$HOME/scalation_1.1/target/scala-2.10/classes


<h4>4. ScalaTion is pre-built, but to re-build the ScalaTion system:</h4>

$ scab

Source packages are in the <b>src/main/scala</b> directory,
class files are in the <b>classes</b> directory, and
documentation files are in the <b>doc</b> directory.
Note: sbt will place class files in <b>target</b> directory.

<h4>5. Run apps (e.g., for process oriented simulation in Bank.scala):</h4>

$ scar apps.process.Bank


<h4>6. Run src test code (e.g., for Regression in scalation.analytics):</h4>

$ scar scalation.analytics.RegressionTest

<h4>7. To use <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.0/docs/home.html"> sbt </a> to build ScalaTion 1.1:</h4>

$ sbt compile

<h4>8. To develop using an IDE:</h4>

download <a href = "http://typesafe.com/stack/downloads/scala-ide">Scala IDE for Eclipse</a>
